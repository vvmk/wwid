# ...what was I doing?
non-intrusive, focus-preserving "what was I doing?" reminders.

#### Planned features:  

##### core:  

+ Provide two CMD+ shortcuts: [EDIT] and [CHECK]
+ (re)mappable system-level keyboard shortcuts (Something under/near right-hand home row that I can reliably steal lower and upper) 
+ Should feel as natural/easy/non-invasive/non-focus-stealing as Spotlight. [EDIT] could even bring up an identical text bar. Focus should never leave the original app.
+ [CHECK] should just flash the most recently added item in a Notifications-esque window (although bigger font, and long enough that 72 columns fits on one line and is easy to read IMMEDIATELY and vanish.
+ Most recent item is visible as long as [CHECK] is held down. (provide 'TOGGLE' option, but 'HOLD' is recommended. This shouldn't be on screen longer than needed to jerk back into focus. This is not a todo list.
+ Only save a small history of things, maybe start with 5-10. Deleting/Editing items shouldn't be necessary. (I've heard at ~60 wpm its more efficient to start a word over than to backspace)
  
##### bonus:  

+ Vim integration - commandeer a register maybe so "{register}yy|dd on a //TODO: will yank/delete right to the wwid list
+ Tmux - add most recent wwid to status bar
